The easiest way to get notified of new posts is to fill out [this email form](http://www.benkuhn.net/email/).

There's also an [RSS feed](/rss/) if you use a feed reader (if you want to try one, I recommend [feedly](http://feedly.com/)). You can get topic-specific RSS feeds for [tech](/rss/tech), [altruism](/rss/effective-altruism), or [misc](/rss/misc) posts.
