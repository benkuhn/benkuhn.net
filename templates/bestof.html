Here are some of my favorite things I've written:

- [Readability, hackability, and abstraction](http://www.benkuhn.net/rha) describes a particularly annoying circle that I often go in while programming.

- [Probability, uncertainty, and markets](http://www.benkuhn.net/prob) discusses a common failure mode of people trying to reason probabilistically, and why the concept of Knightian uncertainty might be more reasonable for a good Bayesian than it sounds.

- [The St. Petersburg "paradox"](http://www.benkuhn.net/petersburg)--if I offer to flip a coin until it comes up heads, doubling the amount that I pay you each time, should you be willing to pay me infinity dollars to play?

- [Why squared error?](http://www.benkuhn.net/squared) explains why the squared error is so ubiquitous in statistics, and why we might or might not expect it to stay that way.

- [Some stories about comparative advantage](http://www.benkuhn.net/advantage) illustrates a better way for aspiring effective altruists to think about the idea of comparative advantage.

Unfortunately, the Internet seems to disagree with me about which ones are the best. Statistically, you might be more likely to enjoy the posts that got the most hits:

- [What happened to all the non-programmers?](http://www.benkuhn.net/nonprog) wonders why I run into so few people in the Bay Area who don't work in tech.

- [A short rant about contra dance etiquette](http://www.benkuhn.net/contra-etiquette) calls out the silliness (and bad gender dynamics) of the norms for asking people to dance.

- [General Miseducation](http://www.benkuhn.net/gened) documents the many pedagogical issues with Harvard's so-called "general education" curriculum.

- [On inclusivity in Less Wrong](http://www.benkuhn.net/inclusivity) comments on people feeling excluded by one of my favorite communities.

- [A critique of effective altruism](http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique) is what happened when I tried to construct the strongest and most plausible arguments against my views on effective altruism.

- [My current plans](http://www.benkuhn.net/plans-i): a post detailing my plans for the future. (Note: this is no longer current, but may still be interesting.)

If you like these and want more, you should [follow updates](/follow/) via email or RSS. In the mean time, there's the [archive](/blog/1/) (and category-specific archives for [tech](/tag/tech/1/), [altruism](/tag/effective-altruism/1/), and [misc](/tag/misc/1/)). I also put some less polished writing on [another site](http://scraps.benkuhn.net/).
