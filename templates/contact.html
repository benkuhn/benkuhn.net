The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:ben.s.kuhn@gmail.com). I check email once a day in the evening, and usually respond within a day or two (though there's high variance during the academic year).

My schedule is high-entropy during the academic year, so I've embedded my calendar below. So if you'd like to chat, why don't you suggest your favorite non-busy time below?

<iframe id="calendar-iframe" src="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;mode=WEEK&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=ben.s.kuhn%40gmail.com&amp;color=%2329527A&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York" style=" border-width:0 " width="520" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

(Disclaimer: sometimes things come up, so the calendar isn't perfect. It should be pretty close, though. Note that all times are in EST.)
