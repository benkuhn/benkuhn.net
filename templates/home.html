I'm Ben! This is where I put things I write, usually about some convex combination of effective altruism, math, computers, philosophy, and other assorted miscellany.

By day I do machine learning at a small startup. Otherwise I enjoy reading, hiking, [making music][], [contra dancing][], fencing, and various other strange activities.
