I'm currently working on:

- Folk music! I play piano and accordion. I and fiddler and
[nyckelharpist](http://www.nyckelharpa.org/about/what-is-a-nyckelharpa/)
[Ruthie](http://www.ruthiebyers.com/) are preparing for our first gig
in September as Stolen Goods.

- [This website](https://github.com/benskuhn/benkuhn.net). I
considered using an off-the-shelf CMS like Wordpress but decided I'd
rather be able to obsess about everything myself to get a feel for web
design.

Previously, I've worked on:

- [Harvard Effective Altruism](http://harvardea.org/), a student
organization at Harvard dedicated to finding and doing the best things
to improve the world. I was co-President from 2012-2014 and led the
group from essentially just me to a group of six organizers and scores
of engaged members. Highlights included hosting talks by philosopher
[Peter Singer](https://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/) and Skype
cofounder [Jaan Tallinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaan_Tallinn).

- [Harvard Class](http://harvard-class.com/), an improved course
catalog and search tool for Harvard. In the three days after our
launch, we received 2400 unique visitors and 200 registered users and
were featured in the [Harvard Crimson][hc-crimson] and
[BostInno][hc-bostinno]. We now boast 25% of the undergraduate student
body as registered users.

- [Trello](https://trello.com/), a "whiteboard with superpowers" that
helps keep people and teams organized. Trello is made by [Fog Creek
Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/), where I interned in summer 2012.

- [Gimblium](http://www.gimblium.com/), an online collaborative game
development suite, with [Billy Janitsch](http://billyjanitsch.com). I
do the server, some front-end work, and the game engine. Gimblium
began as a final project for [cs50](http://cs50.net/), so most of what
you see here was implemented in about a week.

- [Seaweed](http://cweed.org/), a platform for creating and running
economics experiments. I took over programming work during the
academic year of '11-12.

- During summer '10 and '11, I worked at
[Noteflight](http://noteflight.com/), an online music score editing
tool, as an intern and later a full developer. Not only is Noteflight
an amazing company to work for, it's also the only score editor that
isn't truly aggravating to use. I highly recommend it.

- I also made moogle, a fuzzy search engine for musical melodies. Type
in a fragment of melody and Moogle will find the closest matches in
its (meager) database, using an adaptated version of the BLAST
protein-matching algorithm. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to
finding decent hosting for the server (nobody wants to run my awful
kludgy Java indexer), but you can find the code on
[github](https://github.com/benskuhn/moogle) if you're curious. (This
was a week-long independent project for school, so the code is pretty
embarrassingly rushed, but something's better than nothing.)
