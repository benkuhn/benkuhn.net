I recently (May '14) finished college at Harvard, where I majored in math and also messed around with computers. Before that I was extremely lucky to go to [Commonwealth School](http://commschool.org/), a tiny high school in the middle of Boston, where I learned how to read, write, have a work ethic and be a reasonable person.

Also at Commonwealth, I had the good fortune to hear Peter Singer speak about the ideas that would become [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism): basically, that it turns out it's actually very easy to do things that have a huge positive impact, if you think critically about finding them. Although I thought he was nuts at first, I've gradually warmed up to Singer's point of view, and these days I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can most effectively improve the world.
