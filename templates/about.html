I live in Oakland and work engineering at [Wave](http://www.sendwave.com/), making money transfer to Africa faster and cheaper. Before that I worked on machine learning at Theorem, a financial technology startup, and before that I finished a math major at Harvard (with a fair amount of computers on the side). My other academic interests include economics, physics, statistics, philosophy, international development, and various other things.

Before Harvard I was extremely lucky to go to [Commonwealth School](http://commschool.org/), a tiny high school in the middle of Boston, where I learned how to read, write, have a work ethic and be a reasonable person. There I also had the good fortune to hear Peter Singer speak about the ideas that would become [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism): basically, that we should devote much of our energy to finding the best ways of doing good in the world. Although I thought he was nuts at first, I've gradually warmed up to Singer's point of view, and these days I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can contribute.
